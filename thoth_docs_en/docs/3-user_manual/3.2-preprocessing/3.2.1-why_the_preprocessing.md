# Why Preprocessing

Preprocessing is a crucial step in the Thoth application to ensure that data is adequately prepared for advanced analysis and intuitive interactions. This document explores the reasons why preprocessing is fundamental, highlighting the functionalities it supports and the purposes it pursues within the Thoth system.

## 1 - Importance of Preprocessing

Preprocessing represents the foundation for efficient and meaningful data processing. Without this step, raw data present in databases would not be optimized for rapid searches, semantic analysis, or natural language interactions. Preprocessing transforms data into usable formats for advanced functionalities, improving user experience and operation precision.

### 1.1 - Data Preparation for Analysis

Preprocessing prepares database data for advanced analysis by generating structures that facilitate access and processing. This includes creating LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) signatures that allow fast and efficient similarity searches, reducing the time needed to find correlated data.

### 1.2 - Enabling Intuitive Interactions

Another key purpose of preprocessing is enabling intuitive interactions with data, such as transforming natural language questions into executable SQL queries. This is made possible by generating context vectors that capture the semantic meaning of database columns, improving data understanding and querying.

## 2 - Functionalities Supported by Preprocessing

Preprocessing is not just a technical operation, but a set of functionalities that improve the usability and effectiveness of the Thoth system. Below are described the main functionalities that depend on preprocessing.

### 2.1 - Creation of LSH Signatures and Context Vectors

During preprocessing, LSH signatures and context vectors are generated. LSH signatures are compact data representations that allow rapid comparisons to find similar elements, while context vectors represent semantic information of database columns. These structures are essential to ensure that search and analysis operations are fast and accurate.

### 2.2 - Updating Column Descriptions

Preprocessing also includes the ability to update database column descriptions. This process keeps metadata updated, providing detailed information about fields and values contained in the database. This is particularly useful for complex databases that require accurate descriptions for correct data interpretation.

### 2.3 - Support for Natural Language Questions

Preprocessing is fundamental for supporting natural language question functionality in the ThothSL application. By preparing data and context vectors, the system is able to interpret user requests and transform them into relevant SQL queries, making data access accessible even to those who don't know SQL language.

### 2.4 - Using Hints to Improve Responses

Hints, or suggestions, are another element that benefits from preprocessing. This additional information is loaded and used to improve interpretation of user requests. Preprocessing ensures that hints are integrated into the work environment, providing extra context that makes system responses more precise and useful.

## 3 - Preprocessing Purposes

In addition to specific functionalities, preprocessing pursues broader objectives that improve the entire Thoth ecosystem.

### 3.1 - Improving Operational Efficiency

One of the main purposes of preprocessing is improving system operational efficiency. By optimizing data for rapid searches and semantic analysis, preprocessing reduces processing times and allows users to obtain results more quickly and reliably.

### 3.2 - Ensuring Data Accuracy

Preprocessing contributes to ensuring data accuracy by keeping metadata and column descriptions updated. This ensures that users always have access to accurate and relevant information, reducing the risk of errors or misunderstandings during data analysis.

### 3.3 - Facilitating Data Access

Finally, preprocessing facilitates data access by making natural language interaction possible and providing additional contexts through hints. This lowers the entry barrier for non-technical users, allowing a wider audience to leverage the potential of the Thoth system.

In summary, preprocessing is an indispensable element in the Thoth application, which not only prepares data for advanced operations, but also supports functionalities that improve usability, efficiency, and precision. Thanks to preprocessing, Thoth offers a fluid and powerful user experience, transforming complex data into accessible and usable information.
