# Admin Management in ThothAI

Django's administration interface, used by Thoth, provides a complete and intuitive system for data management through a web interface.
Here's how it works:

## 1. Navigation via Side Menu

Every element configured for administration (User, Group, AiModel, Agent, etc.) is automatically accessible through the **navigation menu**
positioned on the left side of the admin interface.

This menu organizes models by application, creating a hierarchical structure that facilitates navigation between different system entities.

## 2. Record List View

Clicking on a side menu link accesses the **list view** that presents all existing records for that particular model.
This view offers a tabular overview of the data, showing the most relevant columns configured by the system administrator.

## 3. Filter System

On the **right side of the list view** various filters are available that allow refining data visualization. These filters can be based on:

- Date fields (with filters for year, month, day)
- Boolean fields (Yes/No)
- Foreign keys (relationships with other models)
- Predefined choice fields

## 4. Access to Detail Form

It is possible to access the **detail form** in two ways:

- **Selecting an existing record** from the list to modify it
- **Clicking the "Add" button** to create a new element

Both actions lead to the same editing interface, adapted respectively for modification or creation.

## 5. Organization in Sections

The detail form can be **organized in logical sections** (fieldsets) that group related fields. This structuring improves usability by allowing to:

- Group related information
- Create collapsible sections for optional fields
- Visually organize complex forms with many fields

## 6. Action Selector

In the list view there is an **action selector** that allows performing operations on multiple records simultaneously.
This tool is typically found at the top of the list and allows applying bulk actions on selected records via checkboxes.

## 7. CSV Import and Export in Thoth

In the Thoth system, among the available actions are always present:

- **Import CSV**: allows importing data from CSV files
- **Export CSV**: allows exporting selected data in CSV format

Import and export files are kept in the **`export` directory** located at the project root. This directory has a **"bind" with the equivalent Docker container**,
allowing users to:

- View exported CSV files directly from the filesystem
- Create and place CSV files to import in the same directory

## 8. Record Deletion

In addition to import/export functions, the **deletion action** is normally available which allows eliminating selected records.
This operation usually requires confirmation to prevent accidental deletions.

## 9. Specific Actions

The system also includes **custom specific commands** for particular project needs.
These commands, called `actions`, are documented in detail in the **specific documentation chapter**, where advanced
functionalities and specialized operations available for each model are described.
