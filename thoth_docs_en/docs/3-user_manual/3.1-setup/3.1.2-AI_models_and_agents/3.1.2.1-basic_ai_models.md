# Basic AI Models

Basic AI Models represent the generic categories of language models (LLM) supported by Thoth, grouped by provider. Each record defines a base provider, such as OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Mistral, etc.

This abstraction allows centrally organizing and managing the different types of LLMs available in the system, serving as a base for configuring more specific models.

## 1 - Model Structure

The `BasicAiModel` table contains the fundamental information to identify and describe a family of AI models.

### 1.1 - Model Fields

Below are listed the fields that define a Basic AI Model:

- **Name**: A unique name that identifies the model family (e.g. "OpenAI", "Anthropic"). This field is mandatory and must be unique.
- **Description**: An optional text field to provide a detailed description of the model family or provider.
- **Provider**: Specifies the language model provider. The value is selected from a predefined list of choices, which includes options such as:
    - `OPENAI`
    - `ANTHROPIC` (Claude)
    - `CODESTRAL`
    - `DEEPSEEK`
    - `META` (LLama)
    - `MISTRAL`
    - `OLLAMA`
    - `OPENROUTER`
    - `GEMINI`
- **Created At**: The date and time when the record was created.
- **Updated At**: The date and time of the last record modification.

## 2 - Relationships with Other Models

The `BasicAiModel` has a direct and fundamental relationship with the `AiModel` model.

### 2.1 - Relationship with AiModel

The relationship between `BasicAiModel` and `AiModel` is of type **one-to-many**. This means that:

- Each `BasicAiModel` can be associated with one or more `AiModel`.
- Each `AiModel` must be connected to only one `BasicAiModel`.

For example, a `BasicAiModel` with `name` "OpenAI" can have multiple associated `AiModel`, such as "gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", etc. This structure allows grouping all variants of a provider under a single category, simplifying model management and selection within Workspaces.

## 3 - Management from Administration Interface

Basic AI Models management is done through Django's administration panel, which offers an intuitive interface to perform all necessary operations.

### 3.1 - Visualization and Search

In the administration section, the list of `BasicAiModel` shows the following columns:

- **Name**: The unique name of the base model.
- **Description**: The provided description.
- **Provider**: The model provider.

It is possible to use the search bar to find a specific model by searching for `name` or `provider`. Additionally, filters are available to narrow the display based on name, description, or provider.

### 3.2 - Creation and Modification

To create a new `BasicAiModel`, simply click the "Add Basic AI Model" button and fill in the form fields. During modification, all fields can be updated as needed.

### 3.3 - Available Actions

From the list of `BasicAiModel`, it is possible to perform the following group actions on one or more selected records:

- **Export selected items to CSV**: Exports selected base models to a CSV file.
- **Import from CSV**: Imports new base models or updates existing ones from a CSV file. This functionality is useful for massive system configuration.
