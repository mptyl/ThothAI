# ThothAI Setup - Activities to Execute

After completing the basic installation of ThothAI, it is necessary to execute some configuration activities
to customize the system according to your needs. Below are the main activities to complete:

## 1. Groups Setup Completion
Groups aggregate different Users with respect to three functionalities:

- the ability to access the administrative area, reserved for members of the Admin group
- the ability to create, modify and delete Hints, Questions and Columns inside the vector database.
This functionality is reserved for Editors
- the ability to see or not see the log messages of the internal behavior of the frontend (ThothSL). Non-technical users, interested only in the result of their query, can indeed be bothered by an excess of information, while more technical users might want to follow in detail the unfolding of SQL generation activities, from keyword identification
to SQL creation and its execution.

For details on Groups management consult the pages:

- [:material-account-group: Groups](../3.1-setup/3.1.1-authentication/3.1.1.1-groups.md)
- [:material-account-cog: Group Profiles](../3.1-setup/3.1.1-authentication/3.1.1.3-group_profiles.md)


The configuration of `Groups` is the first step, and is essential for the correct functioning of the system because it forms the basis
of authorization functionalities and, in part, execution workflow management.

### Necessary checks:

1. **Verify the existence of the most important Groups**

!!! tip "Groups Verification"
   
    Make sure that the groups `Admin`, `Editor` and at least one `User` group exist.

!!! note "Predefined groups"
    By default, the `python manage.py import_groups` command, to be executed at installation time, creates the groups:

    - **Admin**
    - **Editor**
    - **User_Basic**
    - **User**
    - **User_Tech**

2. **Verify Admin group permissions**

   Check that the `Admin` group is associated with all the administration powers provided by the system.

3. **Configure action logs**

   Verify that the visibility of actions performed by ThothSL associated with Groups through `GroupProfile` are those desired. If not, proceed with the necessary modifications.

## 2. Real Users Creation

!!! tip "Using examples"
The `python manage.py import_users` command executed during installation has created the example users `Marco` (User) and `Maria` (TechUser). Use these as reference for creating real users.

### Procedure:

1. Analyze the configuration of example users
2. Create real users following the same schema
3. Associate each user to the appropriate group

## 3. AI Models Verification

!!! warning "AI models check"
It is fundamental to verify that all necessary models are available before proceeding with agent configuration.

### Activities to perform:

- Verify that the loaded `AiModel` are all those necessary for your needs
- The `import-all_csvs` command has created a wide series of predefined configurations
- Add any providers not provided in the default setup that you want to use

## 4. Agents Verification

!!! info "AI agents configuration"
Agents are fundamental components that use AI models to perform specific operations.

### Necessary checks:

- Verify that all `Agent` necessary for your operations are present
- The `import-all_csvs` command has created a wide series of predefined agents
- Add any custom agents that use `AiModels` not provided in the default configuration

## 5. Vector Databases Setup

!!! important "1:1 Relationship"
The relationship between vector database and relational database is **1:1**. It is necessary to define a dedicated vector database for each relational database you want to use.

### Required configuration:

- Configure vector databases to contain relational database metadata
- Each relational database must have its own dedicated vector database
- Verify the correct association between vector and relational databases

### Insights

## 6. Relational Database Setup

!!! note "Target database"
The relational database is the database that contains the actual data on which you want to execute the query. It can be configured locally, on Docker or on external servers.

### Necessary configuration:

- Define the connection to the target relational database
- Configure access parameters (host, port, credentials)
- Verify connectivity and access permissions
- Test basic queries to ensure correct functioning

### Insights

[:material-database-outline: SQL Databases](../3.1-setup/3.1.4-SQL_database/3.1.4.1-sql_dbs.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## 7. Settings Setup

!!! gear "System parameters"
Settings collect some fundamental parameters used in the preprocessing, backend and frontend processes of the system.

### Parameters to configure:

- Settings for data preprocessing processes
- Configurations for the system backend
- Parameters for the frontend interface
- Specific optimizations for the deployment environment

### Insights

[:material-cog: Settings](../3.1-setup/3.1.5.1-settings.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## 8. Workspace Setup

!!! workspace "Work environment"
The Workspace is where the association between the database to be queried, the Agents used by the SQL generation process and the enabled users takes place.

### Required configurations:

- Associate the relational database to the workspace
- Define the AI agents to be used for SQL query generation
- Configure users authorized to access the workspace
- Set specific permissions for each user or group

### Insights

[:material-view-dashboard: Workspace](../3.1-setup/3.1.5.1-settings.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

- [ ] AI Models verified and completed
- [ ] Agents configured for specific needs
- [ ] Vector databases configured for each relational database
- [ ] Relational databases configured and tested
- [ ] System settings set correctly
- [ ] Workspaces configured with appropriate associations

!!! tip "Execution order"
It is recommended to follow the order of activities as presented, as some configurations depend on the previous ones.
