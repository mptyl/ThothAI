# Quick Start Frontend

The [Quick Setup](../1-install/1.4-quick_setup.md) allows the user `marco` to operate on the `california_schools` database
by expressing questions, in English, similar to those that can be found in the `dev.json` file available in the
`data/dev_databases/california_schools` directory of the `Thoth` backend.

The frontend, if operating under Docker, is available at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501),
while if operating locally it is available at [http://localhost:8503](http://localhost:8503)


## 1 - Initial form
Once logged in, with credentials **marco/thoth_pwd**, you access this form:

![Frontend](../assets/index_pngs/VoidFrontend.png)

The form is divided into a sidebar, on the left, and a form that occupies all the rest of the available screen.

## 2 - Sidebar
At the top left of the sidebar there is the workspace selector on which you want to work.

![WksSelecor](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-wksselector.png)

The default setup provides for the activation of only the **California Schools** workspace, so the workspace,
until new workspaces are added, does not allow other choices.

## 3 - Display parameters
In the center of the sidebar there are the parameters that guide the information that the user receives during the execution of
queries.

![Feedback](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-feedback.png)

The sidebar values are those assigned to the User group to which user `marco` belongs. It is possible to modify
the default at any time. Leaving the default values, for each query user `marco` will see:

- what are the keywords extracted from the question, based on which tables and fields were selected
- what are the hints extracted, and passed to the LLM models, to help them understand the request
- the data table resulting from the execution of the generated SQL
- a textual description, in bullet point form, of the generated SQL that clarifies the .................

More "technical" users can see the generated SQL, and others, even more technical, or simply more curious,
can follow the process execution step by step. Go to the [Group Profiles](../3-user_manual/3.1-setup/3.1.1-authentication/3.1.1.3-group_profiles.md) page
for a deeper view of the consequences of these settings.

## 4 - Treat Empty Result as Error
A particular flag is the one called "Treat Empty Result as Error"

![NoEmptyResult](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-noemptyresult.png)

A request can lead to the generation of SQL that, once executed, is formally correct, but produces an empty list as a result.
Sometimes this means that the generated SQL is wrong, sometimes, instead, the question may have generated filters that are too selective. For example:

- if I ask "tell me the customers who are based in Northern Italy" I expect to find some;
- if I ask "tell me the customers who are based in the municipality of Gorgonzola, in via Padana 112" there may not even be one.

The "Treat Empty Result as Error" flag serves precisely to communicate to ThothAI whether to consider a symptom of error (poorly formulated SQL)
a possible empty list in response, or whether to accept it as a possible outcome of the search.

The default value for this flag is False, that is, empty lists are accepted in response. The user can decide from time to time, evaluating how selective
the request they are about to make is, how to set this parameter.

## 5 - Reset
Above the flags that direct the messages received from the backend, there is the Reset button.

![Reset](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-reset.png)

Pressing the Reset button allows you to interrupt the activity at any time, even during workflow execution.
The effect of pressing it, in addition to interrupting the workflow, is zeroing all caches and resetting all work variables.
Finally, by pressing Reset, the management form is cleaned of all messages and re-proposed, empty, for a new question.

!!!info

    It is good practice, even if not strictly necessary, to press the Reset button at the end of each query.
    This way the form is cleaned of all messages from the previous query, avoiding problems understanding the received messages.

## 6 - First SQL Generator

In the sidebar also appears a `First SQL Generator` selector

![Reset](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-firstgen.png)


The basic workflow of SQL generation, capable of answering the question posed by the user, provides for an escalation of increasingly
complex models, and inevitably more expensive, to involve in the process.

In standard configuration, ThotAI starts from a Basic model and then, after three failed attempts, moves to the Advanced and finally Expert model. Obviously, for a real escalation to occur,
it is appropriate that the three mentioned Agents use models of increasing complexity. For example, staying within the Anthropic offering in mid
2025, the Basic could be Sonnet 3.7, the Advanced could be Sonnet 4.0 and the Expert could be Opus 4.0.

The `First SQL Generator` selector allows you to establish which Generator you want to start the escalation with. Based on the complexity
of the database, for example, it may be appropriate to skip the Basic generators and start immediately with an Advanced.

The default of this parameter is set at the workflow level, as each database
can be managed with a different starter point. The user can always modify the default value and decide to start from an Advanced or, even, from an Expert skipping the previous levels.

In case of failure even of the Expert agent, ThothAI is configured to try to use the Titanic solution. Go
to the appropriate page of the [Reference Manual](../4-reference_manual/4.3-workflow/4.3.4-titanic_generation_workflow.md) to see in detail what it is about.

For a general view of the Workflow implemented by ThothAI go to the specific [Reference Manual page](../4-reference_manual/4.3-workflow/4.3.3-basic_generation_workflow.md)

## 7 - Request execution
To ask a question and receive, as an answer, a table containing the response, you just need to behave as you do in front of a normal form for conversations with a GPT.

![Question](../assets/quickstart/Sidebar-question.png)

It is sufficient to insert the question in the appropriate space and press Enter. ThothAI will execute the workflow starting from the indicated SQL Generator
and highlighting, in the response space, the requested messages.

The output that is always exposed is the result table of the query, which can also be composed of a single record. All other
information is highlighted only if explicitly requested. I remind you that you can choose to want to see:
- the Keywords extracted from the question, used for similarity searches
- the Hints extracted from the vector database through similarity search with the question and with the extracted keywords;
- the executed steps, with highlighting of the assigned Agent;
- the generated SQL;
- The specific SQL generation requests, through which you can observe the escalation performed on the various Agents;
- A "non-technical" explanation of the generated SQL, which can accompany the presentation of the request result when the user does not have the skills to evaluate the SQL.

An example of how the form can appear at the end of the query is highlighted below.
