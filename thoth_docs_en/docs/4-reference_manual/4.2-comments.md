# Comments

Comments in Thoth represent a fundamental element for SQL database documentation and management. This section of the user manual explores the role of comments associated with tables and columns, highlighting how Thoth facilitates their creation, modification and use through an intuitive administrative interface and integration with artificial intelligence models.

## 1 - Introduction to Comments in Thoth

Comments are descriptive texts associated with tables (SqlTable) and columns (SqlColumn) within a database. Often, in production databases, many fields lack adequate descriptions or present incomprehensible descriptions, full of acronyms or written in languages different from the main project language. Thoth addresses this problem by offering tools to generate and manage comments effectively, improving database understanding and maintenance.

### 1.1 - Purpose of Comments

Comments serve to provide clear and accessible documentation for database elements. They help developers, administrators and other users understand the meaning and use of tables and columns, especially in complex contexts where the database structure is not immediately intuitive. In Thoth, comments can be used as a basis for updating official descriptions of database elements, ensuring consistent and updated documentation.

### 1.2 - Advantages of Using Comments

- **Clarity**: Comments improve readability of database structures, reducing the risk of interpretive errors.
- **Maintenance**: Accurate documentation facilitates database maintenance and updating.
- **Collaboration**: Comments allow different teams to share a common understanding of data, even in the presence of different languages or conventions.
- **Automation**: Thanks to AI integration, Thoth can generate comments automatically, reducing manual work.

## 2 - AI Comment Generation

Thoth leverages artificial intelligence models to generate meaningful comments for tables and columns, based on existing information and specific contexts. This process is accessible directly from the administration interface, making the operation simple and fast.

### 2.1 - Table and Column Selection

From the admin interface, users can select the tables and columns for which they want to generate comments. This allows focusing on specific database elements that need documentation or updating.

### 2.2 - Context-Based Generation

Once elements are selected, Thoth sends a request to the AI model to generate comments. The system considers:

    - Any existing descriptions, to maintain consistency.
    - The field name, which often provides clues about its purpose.
    - A set of sample data contained in the field (if it's not an ID), to deduce the type of information stored.

This approach ensures that generated comments are relevant and useful, even in the absence of pre-existing documentation.

### 2.3 - Review and Completion

After automatic generation, comments may require manual intervention by an expert operator. This step is crucial to fill any gaps or inaccuracies from the AI, ensuring that the final documentation accurately reflects the database structure and use. Operators can modify comments directly from the admin interface before consolidating them as official descriptions.

## 3 - Copying Comments to Descriptions

Thoth offers functionality to transform generated or modified comments into official descriptions for tables and columns, completing the documentation process.

### 3.1 - Selection for Update

Similar to generation, users can select from the admin interface the tables and columns for which they want to update descriptions from existing comments. This action is particularly useful when comments have been reviewed and approved.

### 3.2 - Copy Action

With a simple command, such as "Copy the generated comment to the column description", users can transfer comment content to official descriptions. This process is supported by administrative actions that ensure rapid and error-free updating.

### 3.3 - Verification and Finalization

After copying comments to descriptions, users can verify that the information is correct and consistent with project needs. This final step ensures that database documentation is complete and ready for use.

## 4 - Limitation on DDL Updates

When database element descriptions are updated, it's important to note that Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are not automatically updated to reflect these changes. This means that structural database definitions, such as table schemas, remain unchanged despite updated descriptions.

### 4.1 - Solution for Schema Description Updates

To address this limitation, users can follow a specific process:

    1. Download CSV files containing table and column details from the system.
    2. Use a dedicated tool designed to transfer updated descriptions from CSV files to the database schema.

This approach allows manual synchronization of descriptions with the schema without directly altering the DDL.

### 4.2 - Organizational Reason for the Limitation

The reason for this limitation is not technical but organizational. Thoth was specifically designed for users without technical expertise. Consequently, it's fundamental to ensure that Thoth does not modify any element that falls under Database Administrator (DBA) responsibilities. This design choice helps maintain a clear separation of duties and prevents accidental changes to critical database structures.

## 5 - Final Considerations

The use of comments in Thoth represents a powerful tool for improving SQL database management. Thanks to the combination of an intuitive user interface and artificial intelligence technologies, Thoth allows overcoming common difficulties related to database documentation, offering a flexible and accessible system for generating, modifying and consolidating table and column descriptions. Users are encouraged to leverage these functionalities to keep their databases well documented and easily understandable.
