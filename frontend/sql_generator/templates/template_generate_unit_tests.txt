Here are the question, the database type, the database schema, the directives the evidence and the list of candidate SQL to evaluate

**QUESTION**
{question}

**DATABASE TYPE**
{dbmanager.db_type}

**DATABASE SCHEMA**
{used_mschema}

**DIRECTIVES**
The SQL generator being tested must strictly follow these directives:
{directives}

**EVIDENCE**
{evidence_for_template}

**CANDIDATES SQL**
{sql_candidate_list}

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- DO NOT test for the presence or absence of a specific field
- Do NOT test for the presence, absence, or usage of subqueries
- Do NOT test for specific implementation approaches (subqueries vs joins vs other methods)
- The SQL generator must be free to choose any valid approach to accomplish the task
- Only test correctness, not implementation preferences
- Ensure the SQL generator follows the directives provided above

Generate from 7 to 14 comprehensive unit tests based on the question and schema above. Provide your reasoning in the thinking field and the list of test statements in the answers field.
