*** SQL Query to Evaluate: ***
{SQL_QUERY}

*** Tests to Apply: ***
{UNIT_TESTS}

You are evaluating if this SQL query passes each test listed above.

For your thinking field:
- Keep it extremely brief or leave empty.

For your answers field:
Provide a LIST of strings - one for EACH test.

Each string must be formatted as:
"Test #{number}: {result}"

Where result is EXACTLY one of:
- "OK" if the SQL passes that specific test
- "KO - {brief_reason}" if the SQL fails that specific test

Example for 3 tests:
[
  "Test #1: OK",
  "Test #2: KO - missing WHERE clause", 
  "Test #3: OK"
]

CRITICAL: You MUST provide exactly as many answer strings as there are tests.
