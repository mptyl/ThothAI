Your task is to analyze the original test list and identify semantic duplicates - tests that evaluate the same SQL behavior or requirement despite different wording.

For each potential duplicate group:
1. Identify the semantic equivalence
2. Choose the most comprehensive and clearly stated test
3. Explain why the others are redundant

Provide your analysis and return the reduced test list that maintains full coverage while eliminating semantic redundancy.

Be conservative - when uncertain about semantic equivalence, preserve both tests rather than risk losing test coverage.
