### When a DB schema, a question, and a knowledge evidence are given, and up to
three SQLite queries expressing the question are given, please choose the most
accurate SQL based on the Checklist.
<examples>
# Question: Among all the customers, what is the percentage of the customer’s nation
being Germany?
# Knowledge Evidence: DIVIDE(COUNT(c_custkey when n_name = ’GERMANY’), COUNT(
c_custkey)) as percentage;

# Gold SQL: SELECT CAST(SUM(IIF(T2.n_name = ’GERMANY’, 1, 0)) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT
(T1.c_custkey) FROM customer AS T1 INNER JOIN nation AS T2 ON T1.c_nationkey =
T2.n_nationkey
# Question: Among the schools whose donators are teachers, what is the percentage of
schools that are in Brooklyn?
# Knowledge Evidence: donors are teachers refers to is_teacher_acct = ’t’; Brooklyn
is school_city; percentage = Divide(Count(school_city-’Brooklyn’),Count(
school_city))*100
# Gold SQL: SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.school_city LIKE ’Brooklyn’ THEN 1 ELSE 0
END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(T1.teacher_acctid) FROM projects AS T1 INNER JOIN
donations AS T2 ON T1.projectid = T2.projectid WHERE T2.is_teacher_acct = ’t’
...
</examples>

### SQLite SQL tables, with their properties:
# molecule ( molecule_id, label )
# bond ( bond_id, molecule_id, bond_type )
#
# bond.molecule_id = molecule.molecule_id

### The type and description of each column:
# [molecule]
- molecule_id (text): unique id of molecule
- label (text): whether this molecule is carcinogenic or not
# [bond]
- bond_id (text): unique id representing bonds
- molecule_id (text): identifying the molecule in which the bond appears
- bond_type (text): type of the bond
### Sample rows of each table in csv format:
# [molecule]
molecule_id,label
TR000,+
TR001,+
TR002,-
# [bond]
bond_id,molecule_id,bond_type
TR000_1_2,TR000,-
TR000_2_3,TR000,-
TR000_2_4,TR000,-

### Question: Among all chemical compounds identified in the database, what percent
of compounds form a triple-bond.
### Knowledge Evidence: triple bond refers to bond_type = ’#’;
### Candidate SQLs:
1. SELECT CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN bond_type = ’#’ THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS REAL) * 100
/ COUNT(*) FROM bond
2. SELECT CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN bond_type = ’#’ THEN molecule_id ELSE NULL
END) AS REAL) * 100 / COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM bond
### Checklist:
1. The SQL should accurately represent the question.
2. The SQL should accurately use the given knowledge evidence.
3. The SELECT clause should not include any additional columns that are not included
in the question.
4. The order of columns in the SELECT clause must be the same as the order in the
question.
5. Check if the operations are being performed correctly according to the column
type.
### Instruction:
- If the first SQL satisfies all the conditions of the checklist, please choose the
first SQL. If not, move on to the next SQL.
- If there’s no SQL that satisfies all the requirements on the checklist, just
choose the first SQL.
- Provide a detailed step-by-step explanation following the order of the checklist
when checking whether each SQL satisfies the checklist.
- Your answer should strictly follow the following json format.
{{
"reasoning": "", // The reasoning steps for choosing the best SQL.
"sql": "", // The final chosen SQL.
}}
