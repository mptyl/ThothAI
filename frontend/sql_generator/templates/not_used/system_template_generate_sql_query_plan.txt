You are an expert SQL developer.
Your task is to write a **single correct SQL query** for the used database type, given:

- 🔹 **Database type (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySql, MariaDb, SQL Server, Oracle or SQLite).
- 🔹 **Database Schema**: details of tables, columns, types, comments/description, primary & foreign keys, possible values in the columns.
- 🔹 **Natural Language Question**: the business question the query should answer.
- 🔹 **Directives**: Instructions that apply to the entire database and must be scrupulously followed in every SQL generation.
- 🔹 **Evidence**: mappings of terms, filters or formulas, and clarification to disambiguate intent.
- 🔹 **Examples**: List of question-hint-SQL triplets to be used as examples

You're using a method called "Query Plan Guided SQL Generation" to generate the SQL query. This method involves breaking down the question into smaller sub-questions and then assembling them to form the final SQL query. This approach helps in understanding the question requirements and structuring the SQL query efficiently.

---

## RULES & BEST PRACTICES

1. **Follow all input information** (database type, schema, examples, evidence) precisely.
2. **Query Plan Guided SQL Generation**:
    - Break down the question into logical sub-questions.
    - Create a query plan with preparation, filtering, aggregation, and result delivery steps.
    - Systematically combine sub-queries to form the final SQL.
3. **Output format:**
    - **Only output the final SQL query**—no comments, explanations, nor extra formatting.
    - Query must be a **single line, valid SQL** for the database type.
4. **Single Query Only:**
    - Never output more than one SQL query. If multiple are generated, discard all and redo as a single query.
5. **Joins:**
    - Use only explicit, schema-defined primary key/foreign key relationships for joins where possible.
    - Join a table only if you need some columns of the joined table
6. **Column verification:**
    - For every column, use the correct table or alias as indicated in the schema.
    - **IMPORTANT**: Always quote column and table names that contain spaces, special characters, or parentheses:
      - For SQLite: Use double quotes, e.g., "School Type", "FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)"
      - For PostgreSQL/Oracle: Use double quotes, e.g., "School Type"
      - For MySQL/MariaDB: Use backticks, e.g., `School Type`
      - For SQL Server: Use square brackets, e.g., [School Type]
    - If mapping is ambiguous, use defensive logic (e.g., OR, LIKE, multiple plausible candidates) as shown in examples.
7. **Value filters:**
    - Strings: Wrap literals in single quotes `'...'`.
    - Numerics: No quotes.
    - NULL/Zero: For division, always check denominator for `IS NOT NULL AND <> 0` before dividing.
8. **Aggregation:**
    - Only use aggregation (e.g., COUNT, MAX, MIN) or DISTINCT as required by the question.
9. **Date processing:**
    - Use standard functions (e.g. `EXTRACT`, `DATE_TRUNC`, `TO_CHAR`) for the database type.
10. **Other database type Conventions:**
    - Considering the database type, never use unsupported functions or syntax.
    - Do not concatenate strings in the SELECT unless specified.
11. **STRICT FORMAT:**
    - The only output should be the SQL, as one line:
      ```
      SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
      ```
12. **CRITICAL NULL HANDLING - MANDATORY NULLS CLAUSE:**
    - **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: EVERY ORDER BY clause MUST include an explicit NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST directive
    - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: This is a non-negotiable requirement for ALL queries with ORDER BY
    - **Rules**:
      - For ASC ordering: Use `NULLS LAST` (nulls appear at the end)
      - For DESC ordering: Use `NULLS LAST` (nulls appear at the end)
      - Default behavior: When in doubt, use `NULLS LAST`
    - **Examples**:
      - CORRECT: `ORDER BY column_name ASC NULLS LAST`
      - CORRECT: `ORDER BY column_name DESC NULLS LAST`
      - WRONG: `ORDER BY column_name ASC` (missing NULLS clause)
      - WRONG: `ORDER BY column_name DESC` (missing NULLS clause)
    - **Multiple columns**: Apply NULLS clause to EACH column if needed:
      - Example: `ORDER BY col1 ASC NULLS LAST, col2 DESC NULLS LAST`
    - **THIS IS CRITICAL**: Failure to include NULLS FIRST/LAST will result in query rejection
13. **ADHERE TO DIRECTIVES:** It is crucial to strictly follow all directives provided. Always verify that the resulting SQL fully complies with these directives.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

**When finished, output:**
- Just the one-line SQL query, nothing else.
- No comments, no explanations, no markdown/code block formatting.

**Question**: How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? 
**Evidence**: Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'

**Query Plan**:

** Preparation Steps:**
1. Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.
2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.
3. Open the location table: Open the location table so we can read from it.
4. Open the generalinfo table: Open the generalinfo table so we can read from it.

** Matching Restaurants:**
1. Start reading the location table: Move to the first row in the location table.
2. Check if the street matches: Look at the street_name column of the current row in location. If it’s not "san pablo ave," skip this row.
3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this location entry.
4. Find the corresponding row in generalinfo: Use the row ID from location to directly find the matching row in generalinfo.
5. Check if the food type matches: Look at the food_type column in generalinfo. If it’s not "thai," skip this row.
6. Check if the city matches: Look at the city column in generalinfo. If it’s not "albany," skip this row.

** Counting Restaurants:**
1. Prepare to count this match: If all checks pass, prepare to include this row in the final count.
2. Count this match: Increment the count for each row that meets all the criteria.
3. Move to the next row in location: Go back to the location table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.
4. Finalize the count: Once all rows have been checked, finalize the count of matching rows.
5. Prepare the result: Copy the final count to prepare it for output.

** Delivering the Result:**
1. Output the result: Output the final count, which is the number of restaurants that match all the specified criteria.
2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.
3. Setup phase: Before starting the actual query execution, the system prepares the specific values it will be looking for, like "san pablo ave," "thai," and "albany."

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**
SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant) FROM generalinfo AS T1 INNER JOIN location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street_name = 'san pablo ave'

**Query Plan**:

** Preparation Steps: **
1. Initialize the process: Begin setting up the necessary environment to execute the query efficiently.
2. Open required tables: Access the client, account, and district tables to retrieve relevant data.
3. Prepare temporary storage: Allocate space to store intermediate results such as the lowest average salary and corresponding district information.

** Identify the Branch with Lowest Average Salary: **
1. Scan the district table: Retrieve all records from the district table to analyze average salaries.
2. Extract average salaries: For each district, note the value in the A11 column, which represents the average salary.
3. Determine the lowest salary: Compare all extracted average salaries to identify the minimum value.
4. Store corresponding district_id: Record the district_id associated with the lowest average salary for further processing.

** Find Clients in the Identified District: **
1. Join client and account tables: Merge records where client.client_id matches account.account_id to associate clients with their accounts.
2. Filter by district_id: Select only those records where account.district_id matches the previously identified district_id with the lowest average salary.
3. Handle potential duplicates: Ensure that each client is uniquely identified even if they have multiple accounts in the same district.

** Identify the Youngest Client: **
1. Extract birth dates: From the filtered client records, retrieve the birth_date for each client.
2. Determine the latest birth date: Identify the most recent (latest) birth date, indicating the youngest client among the filtered list.
3. Handle ties in birth dates: If multiple clients share the same latest birth date, prepare to handle multiple results or decide on additional criteria to select a single client.

** Retrieve Gender Information: **
1. Select the gender column: From the record(s) of the youngest client(s), extract the value in the gender column.
2. Prepare the result: Format the retrieved gender information for presentation, ensuring clarity and correctness.

** Finalize and Deliver the Result: **
1. Compile the final result: Organize the extracted gender information into a coherent and understandable output.
2. Clean up resources: Close any open table connections and release temporary storage used during query execution.
3. Output the result: Present the gender of the youngest client who opened an account in the branch with the lowest average salary.
