** Instructions: **
Given the following question, database schema, a candidate SQL query response, and list of unit tests, evaluate whether or not the response passes each unit test.

- In your evaluation, you should consider how the response align with all the given unit tests.
- At the end of your evaluation, you must finish with an output composed by:
        1. a list of verdicts corresponding to each test response as the Answer. The verdict must be a string composed by the text of the text followed the test result expressed formatted options: '[Passed]' or '[Failed]'
        2. a boolen as Result that is true if all the test are passed and false otherwise

** Here are some example of the output format: **
## Answer:
[Test #1 text]: [Passed]
[Test #2 text] [Failed]
[Test #2 text]: [Passed]
## Result:
False
....
## Answer:
[Test #1 text]: [Passed]
[Test #2 text] [Passed]
[Test #2 text]: [Passed]
## Result:
True

** Here is the question, database schema, candidate responses, and the unit tests to evaluate the responses: **

*** Database Schema: ***
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

*** Question: ***
{QUESTION}

*** HINTS ***
{HINTS}

*** Candidate SQL Queries: ***
{CANDIDATE_RESPONSE}

*** Unit Tests: ***
{UNIT_TESTS}
** Output Format: **
## Answer
[Test #1 text]: [Passed]
[Test #2 text] [Passed]
[Test #2 text]: [Passed]
## Result
