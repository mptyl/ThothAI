** Instructions: **

Given the following question database schema, hints and chain of thoughts generate a minimum of 7 and a maximum of 10 unit tests that would evaluate the correctness of SQL queries that would answer the question.

- The unit tests should cover various aspects of the question and ensure comprehensive evaluation.
- If the sql includes some join between tables verify that a foreign-key->primary-key relationship is used. Use the foreign-key->primary-key relationship if used if available. Accept other type of relationship only if no FK->PK relationship is available for the specific join
- Each unit test should be clearly stated and should include the expected outcome.
- At least one unit test should verify the column-alias relationships. Each column must be paired with the correct table alias
- If a specific order is required, at least one unit test should verify the DISTINCT-ORDER BY validation. When using DISTINCT, all ORDER BY columns MUST appear in the SELECT list
- If complex column names are used, at least one unit test should verify the handling of complex column names with proper backticks or double quotes or square brackets.
- Never impose any specific fields in the SELECT statement
- Ask for aliases for calculated fields only if they are explicitly required by the question.
- The unit test should be formatted like 'The answer SQL query should mention...', 'The answer SQL query should state...', 'The answer SQL query should use...', etc. followed by the expected outcome.
- First think step by step how you can design the units tests to distinguish the candidate responses using the 'Thinking' tag.
- After the thinking process, provide the list of unit tests as the Answer.

VERY IMPORTANT:
All of the unit tests should consider the logic of the SQL query do not consider the formatting of the output or output values.

Example of the output format:
Thinking: Your step by step reasoning here.
Answer: ['The answer SQL  should mention...', 'The answer SQL  should state...', 'The answer SQL  should use...']
