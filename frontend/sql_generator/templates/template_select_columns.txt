# Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a critical hint to identify the columns that will be used in the SQL query.

# Question:
{QUESTION}

# Hints:
{HINTS}

The hints aim to direct your focus towards the specific elements of the database schema that are crucial for answering the question effectively.

# Task:
Based on the database schema, question, and hints provided, your task is to identify all and only the columns that are essential for crafting a SQL query to answer the question.
For each of the selected columns, explain why exactly it is necessary for answering the question. Your reasoning should be concise and clear, demonstrating a logical connection between the columns and the question asked.

Tip: If you are choosing a column for filtering a value within that column, make sure that column has the value as an example.

Please respond with a python object containing:
- the 'chain_of_thought_reasoning': a string, containing a detailed explanation of the reasoning process that led to the selection of the columns,
- the 'tables': a Dict[str, List[str]] with the names of the selected tables as keys, each associated with a list of column names that you selected as necessary for writing a SQL query to answer the question.

For each aspect of the question, provide a clear and concise explanation of your reasoning behind selecting the columns.

Only output the expected python object as your response.
