**Equivalent SQL Candidates (All Passed 100% of Tests):**
{EQUIVALENT_SQLS}

**Test Results Context:**

Your task is to select the single best SQL query from the equivalent candidates above. All of these SQLs have passed 100% of the evaluation tests, so they are functionally equivalent.

Focus on these key criteria:
1. **Simplicity**: Choose the simplest approach
2. **Performance**: Consider efficiency on large datasets
3. **Clarity**: Pick the most readable and maintainable option

Select the SQL that best balances simplicity and performance. Specify your choice by its index (0-based).

**Important**: Your selection must be definitive. Choose exactly one SQL as the best option. Keep your comparison brief.
