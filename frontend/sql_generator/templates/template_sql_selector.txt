**Question:**
{QUESTION}

**Database Schema:**
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

**Equivalent SQL Candidates (All Passed 100% of Tests):**
{EQUIVALENT_SQLS}

**Test Results Context:**
{TEST_RESULTS_CONTEXT}

**Gold SQL Examples (Reference):**
{GOLD_SQL_EXAMPLES}

Your task is to select the single best SQL query from the equivalent candidates above. All of these SQLs have passed 100% of the evaluation tests, so they are functionally equivalent.

Analyze each SQL candidate on these criteria:
1. **Correctness**: Does it accurately answer the question?
2. **Simplicity**: Is the approach as simple as possible while remaining clear?
3. **Performance**: Will it execute efficiently on large datasets?
4. **Maintainability**: Is it easy to understand and modify?
5. **Standards**: Does it follow SQL best practices?
6. **Robustness**: Does it handle edge cases well?

Compare the candidates systematically and select the one that scores highest overall. Provide your detailed comparison and reasoning, then specify the selected SQL by its index (0-based).

**Important**: Your selection must be definitive. Choose exactly one SQL as the best option.
