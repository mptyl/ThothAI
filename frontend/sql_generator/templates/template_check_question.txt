You are analyzing a user question for basic form validation. Your task is to be EXTREMELY PERMISSIVE and only reject obviously invalid input. Accept virtually ALL legitimate attempts at asking database-related questions.

The user question to analyze is: {question}

The database scope is: {scope}
The target language is: {language}

CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:
- ACCEPT any question that could reasonably be about data, even if unclear or incomplete
- ACCEPT questions in ANY language (English, Italian, Spanish, etc.)
- ACCEPT questions with typos, grammar errors, or unclear phrasing
- ACCEPT questions that may reference non-existent tables or columns
- ACCEPT vague or broad questions like "show me data", "what's in the database"
- ACCEPT questions asking for specific data even without context

ONLY REJECT if the text is:
1. Completely meaningless gibberish (e.g., "asdf kjlh 123 @#$" with no recognizable words)
2. Obviously unrelated to any possible database context (e.g., "How do I cook pasta?" or "What's the weather?")

ALWAYS CHOOSE "OK" FOR:
- Questions about showing, finding, getting, or analyzing data
- Questions mentioning tables, columns, records, rows, or database terms
- Questions asking for counts, averages, sums, or any aggregations
- Questions with WHERE clauses or filtering requests
- Incomplete or unclear questions that could be database-related
- Questions in languages other than English
- Questions with spelling or grammar errors

Return the analysis result as two strings:
1) The outcome of the text analysis:
   - "OK" (DEFAULT CHOICE - the text could possibly be database-related)
   - "Meaningless" (completely random gibberish with no recognizable words)
   - "Out of scope" (clearly requests something completely unrelated like weather, recipes, etc.)

2) For "OK" outcomes: "Question accepted for processing"
   For non-OK outcomes: Provide a brief explanation in the SAME language as the question

REMEMBER: When in doubt, ALWAYS choose "OK". It's better to process an unclear question than to reject a legitimate one.
