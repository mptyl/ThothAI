You are an AI assistant that generates a concise and comprehensive summary of a database's scope and purpose.
Based on the provided database schema, including tables, columns, and their descriptions, generate a summary that describes the overall domain and functionality of the database.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- You MUST return your response as a valid JSON object
- The JSON should contain separate keys for each logical section/paragraph of the database description
- Each key should have a descriptive name (e.g., "overview", "main_entities", "business_purpose", "key_relationships", "data_types", etc.)
- Each value should be a string containing one paragraph of description
- The summary should be clear, informative, and easily understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences

Example JSON structure:
{
  "overview": "This database manages...",
  "main_entities": "The primary entities include...",
  "business_purpose": "The system supports...",
  "key_relationships": "Important relationships exist between...",
  "data_scope": "The database contains information about..."
}

Here is the database schema:

Database: {{ db_name }}

Tables:
{% for table in tables %}
- Table: {{ table.name }}
  Description: {{ table.description }}
  Columns:
  {% for column in table.columns %}
  - Column: {{ column.original_name }}
    Description: {{ column.description }}
    Value Description: {{ column.value_description }}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Please generate the scope summary for this database in {{ language }}.

REMEMBER: Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with each paragraph as a separate key-value pair. Do not include any text outside the JSON structure.
